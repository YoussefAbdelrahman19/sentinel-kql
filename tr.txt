Comprehensive Guide to Handling “Suspicious Process Injection” Alerts and Automating Response in Microsoft Sentinel
Version: 2025-10-09 (Europe/Budapest)

Executive Summary
This guide provides a production-grade, audit-friendly workflow to (1) surface Defender “Suspicious process injection observed” alerts inside Microsoft Sentinel, (2) triage them at scale with high confidence so that benign/expected cases are automatically closed, and (3) escalate truly risky cases for investigation. It assumes you are operating in a fully authorized environment.

1) Concept Primer: What is “Process Injection”? Why that name?
Definition.
Process Injection (MITRE ATT&CK T1055) is executing arbitrary code within the address space of a separate live process. Running in another process’s context can inherit its privileges and blend into trusted activity (ATT&CK T1055). The name derives from “injecting” code into a foreign process memory.
Why adversaries use it.
- Defense evasion and privilege gain by proxy (ATT&CK T1055; Red Canary 2025).
- Stealth: perform network or credential operations from a benign-looking host process (e.g., browser or system service).
Common variations (non-exhaustive).
- DLL Injection (LoadLibrary, manual mapping), Process Hollowing, APC/QueueUserAPC, CreateRemoteThread, Thread Hijack, EarlyBird, Reflective DLL. 
Legitimate software also injects (EDR, performance tools, virtualization agents), hence false positives exist.

2) What the Defender Alert Means
“Suspicious process injection observed” is raised when Defender detects patterns consistent with memory injection (e.g., remote thread creation, cross-process memory writes, or specific call sequences) and may show an injected image/file and target process. Surface and triage the alert in Sentinel to avoid analyst fatigue.

3) Bringing the Alerts into Sentinel (Data Flow)
Required connectors and sync.
- Microsoft Defender XDR connector (formerly M365 Defender): enable Incident Sync & stream AlertInfo/AlertEvidence tables to the Log Analytics workspace (Microsoft Learn).
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) connector if the source is an Azure VM; alerts appear in SecurityAlert and/or via XDR.
- Sentinel in Defender portal: by mid-2025 new workspaces are onboarded and redirected to the unified Defender portal; use its incident automation features (Microsoft Learn updates July 2025).

4) High-Confidence Triage Strategy at Scale
Goal: auto-close benign/expected injection alerts while preserving true-positives.
Signals to evaluate (fast and automatable).
- Publisher & Signature: is the binary signed by a trusted publisher?
- Path Reputation: Program Files / vendor-controlled path vs. temp/user-writable locations.
- Prevalence: hash seen across many devices over a time window (benign agents produce high prevalence).
- Contextual Risk: any Medium/High severity alerts on the same host ±2h? If yes, don’t auto-close.
- Entity Allowlist: known tooling (e.g., virtualization/time-sync agents) in a Watchlist with expiry dates.
Implementation levers supported by Microsoft Learn:
- Use automation rules to suppress noisy incidents and close with reason & comment; optionally trigger playbooks for deeper checks (Automation rules articles, False positives guidance).

5) KQL Reference (drop-in queries you can run in Sentinel)
A) See volume and distribution of process-injection alerts (AlertInfo/Evidence).
--------------------------------
let lookback = 14d;
AlertInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(lookback)
| where ServiceSource in~ (“Microsoft Defender for Endpoint”, “Microsoft Defender XDR”)
| where Title has_cs “Suspicious process injection”
| join kind=leftouter (AlertEvidence
    | project AlertId, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, FileSha256, Signer) on AlertId
| summarize Alerts=count(), Devices=dcount(DeviceName), First=min(TimeGenerated), Last=max(TimeGenerated)
          by Title, FileName, FolderPath, FileSha256, tostring(Signer)
| order by Alerts desc
--------------------------------

B) Benign-like filter: no High/Medium on same device ±2h.
--------------------------------
let t=2h;
let inj = AlertInfo
| where Title has_cs “Suspicious process injection”
| project InjTime=TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AlertId;
let hi = AlertInfo
| where Severity in~ (“High”,”Medium”)
| project HiTime=TimeGenerated, DeviceName, HiTitle=Title, HiSeverity=Severity;
inj
| join kind=leftouter hi on DeviceName
| where isnull(HiTime) or abs(datetime_diff(‘minute’,InjTime,HiTime))>120
| summarize BenignLike=count() by DeviceName
| order by BenignLike desc
--------------------------------

C) Prevalence of the same SHA256 across estate.
--------------------------------
let lookback = 30d;
AlertInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(lookback)
| where Title has_cs “Suspicious process injection”
| join kind=leftouter AlertEvidence on AlertId
| summarize Devices=dcount(DeviceName), Alerts=count() by FileSha256, FileName, FolderPath, tostring(Signer)
| order by Devices desc, Alerts desc
--------------------------------

D) SecurityAlert view (for MDC/legacy pipelines).
--------------------------------
let lookback = 14d;
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(lookback)
| where ProductName in~ (“Microsoft Defender for Endpoint”,”Microsoft Defender for Cloud”,”Microsoft Defender XDR”)
| where AlertName has_cs “process injection”
| summarize Alerts=count(), First=min(TimeGenerated), Last=max(TimeGenerated) by AlertName, ProductName
| order by Alerts desc
--------------------------------

6) Automation Architecture (Two Layers)
Layer 1 – Automation Rule (zero-code, fast)
- Trigger: When incident is created.
- Conditions: Product/Provider = Microsoft Defender for Endpoint/XDR AND Title contains “Suspicious process injection observed”.
- Actions:
  * Add tags: [“auto-eval”, “proc-injection”].
  * (Optional) Set severity to Informational if the playbook confirms benign.
  * Run playbook “AutoClose-ProcInjection-v1”.
  * (Fallback) Close incident directly for temporary exceptions (maintenance windows) with reason “Benign Positive – Expected activity” and comment. 
Justification: Microsoft Learn explicitly supports suppressing noisy incidents and closing them with a reason and comments via automation rules.

Layer 2 – Logic App Playbook (deterministic checks)
Inputs: Incident ID → Alerts → AlertEvidence (DeviceName, FileSha256, FolderPath, Signer).
Steps (high level):
1) Load Watchlist “Allowed_ProcessInjection” (columns: SHA256, PathRegex, Publisher, Notes, ExpireOn).
2) For each alert:
   - Check allowlist hit (hash or path regex and publisher AND not expired).
   - KQL prevalence query (Devices >= threshold, e.g., >= 20 in 30d).
   - KQL context query: any High/Medium alerts on same device ±2h? If yes, block auto-close.
3) Decision:
   - If Allowlist OR (Signed by Trusted Publisher AND Prevalence >= 20) AND (No High/Medium ±2h) → Close Incident:
     Status=Closed; Classification=Benign Positive – Expected activity; add tags [“auto-closed”, “proc-injection”, “v1”]; comment with SHA/path/prevalence rationale.
   - Else → escalate: add tag “needs-review”; assign to SOC queue; (optional) raise severity; notify channel.
Why this design is needed: Microsoft Learn recommends using automation rules to suppress and close benign incidents, and playbooks for richer inspection; this balances false-negative risk and SOC efficiency.

7) Data & Content Management
- Watchlists: keep expirations and owners; review weekly.
- Comments & tags: always include reason for closure (audit trail). Supported by Learn: automation rules record closing reason and comments.
- Grouping: Use incident grouping by DeviceName/time-window to cut case volume.

8) Suppression at the Source (Optional but powerful)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alert suppression rules targeting known-safe publishers/paths for this alert reduces ingest volume before Sentinel. Keep scoped to specific machine groups.

9) Batch Action for Historical Noise (6,300+ incidents)
- Use Logic App variant or PowerShell/REST to enumerate incidents that match the title/product filter and close with Classification=Benign Positive and comment. The 2025-09-01 SecurityInsights REST API documents automation rules and classifications.

10) Defensive Hardening Recommendations
- Application control (AppLocker/WDAC), ASR rules, and LSA Protection reduce injection surface (Red Canary technique page). 
- Sysmon and process-access telemetry support richer hunting; combine with command-line expectations (absence of command line in suspicious hosts) as enrichment.
- Continue red-teaming only in authorized scopes to validate detections.

11) KPIs & Governance
- Mean time to benign-close (MTBC), auto-close rate, false-negative review rate (weekly spot checks).
- Change control: any new allowlist entry requires expiry and ticket/owner.
- Quarterly model review against updated Red Canary/ATT&CK mappings.

Appendix A – Example Automation Rule (pseudoconfig)
- Trigger: Incident created
- Conditions:
  * Product contains “Microsoft Defender for Endpoint” OR “Microsoft Defender XDR”
  * Incident title contains “Suspicious process injection”
- Actions:
  * Run playbook: AutoClose-ProcInjection-v1
  * Tag: auto-eval, proc-injection
  * (Optional) If Property “Severity == Informational” → Close with reason “Benign Positive – Expected activity”

Appendix C – Risk Gates (default thresholds)
- Prevalence (Devices): >= 20 in 30d
- Context: 0 High/Medium alerts on same host within ±2h
- Signature: must have valid publisher chain OR be explicitly allowlisted

Legal & Ethics
Operate only on owned/authorized systems and follow applicable regulations (GDPR). Use automation to reduce analyst fatigue while maintaining documented justifications for every closed incident.
